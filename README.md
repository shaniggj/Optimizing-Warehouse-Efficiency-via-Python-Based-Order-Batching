## Introduction

In modern logistics, optimizing warehouse operations is crucial. Walking time can significantly impact efficiency and productivity. This project provides a Python tool that simulates different order-picking strategies. By using this tool, warehouse managers can make informed decisions to enhance their operations.

## Features

- **Simulation of Picking Routes**: Visualize and analyze various picking strategies.
- **2D Layout Support**: Test strategies on a realistic 2D warehouse layout.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Data Visualization**: Gain insights through clear visual representations of data.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust settings to fit specific warehouse needs.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaniggj/Optimizing-Warehouse-Efficiency-via-Python-Based-Order-Batching.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Optimizing-Warehouse-Efficiency-via-Python-Based-Order-Batching
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the tool.

## Strategies

### Wave Picking

Wave picking is a method where orders are grouped into waves. Each wave is processed separately, allowing for better organization and efficiency. This strategy minimizes the distance traveled by pickers, leading to faster order fulfillment.

### Clustering

Clustering groups items based on their locations within the warehouse. This method reduces the time spent traveling between different sections. By implementing clustering, warehouses can optimize their picking routes and enhance overall productivity.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization plays a key role in understanding warehouse operations. The tool provides various visual outputs, including:

- **Heatmaps**: Identify high-traffic areas within the warehouse.
- **Route Maps**: Visualize the paths taken by pickers.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track the efficiency of different strategies.

These visualizations help warehouse managers make data-driven decisions.
